#### Advection and Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) are interactive Mathematica-style documents where
you can write and run python code, write text, math, and display plots.  They
are great for early exploring and testing, and for sharing work with others.

If you installed Python with Anaconda, you probably already have Jupyter! Just
do `jupyter notebook` on your command line of choice (Git Bash or Powershell on
Windows, Terminal on Mac and Linux).  This will open up a new tab in your
internet browser, where you can run the notebook, save files, etc.

If you do not have Jupyter installed, you can install it with `pip`.  Just do
`pip install jupyter` and you will be all set!
